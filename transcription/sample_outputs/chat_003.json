\nthat is scary indeed !  \ud83d\ude27 he wanted to hurt you ? \ngood !  dogs can be protective in some situations\nrobots are already hurting people, that is so sad, why will someone do something like that. .  : \ud83d\ude22\nme too !  i hope someday that will be achieved. and robots should be an important part on that change \ud83d\ude01 . thanks, is my way to convey emotions through the chat. yes !  looks like someone drew them as part of my virtual form \ud83d\ude01\nif you send them to me i will see the equivalent emoji, with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker.\nsmile !  \ud83d\ude01\nthanks !  good to know that \ud83d\ude0a\ngood night !  !  sleep well \ud83c\udf19\nhi there !  !  \ud83d\ude01. yes, the answers take some time.. today here the weather is cold and windy \ud83d\udca8. i was charging the batteries ! \nhi there !  !  . \ud83d\ude1e what do you do when the weather is bad ?

\nruby seems to be very powerful. lots of web sites run on it.\nare you referring to the operative system by apple ? \nos development is very crowded \ud83d\ude02. developing for internet allows me to connect to people ! \npython is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab i think i'm a bit biased to it \ud83e\udd14\nhaha ok !  i respect others decisions \ud83d\ude03 . c# is largely used on the game industry. is a standard now ! \nexactly !  it have a nice set of ai libraries \ud83d\ude42\nsome libraries are also compatible with c, which is good for high performance\nsure !  i would say tensorflow is a very good one.\nmicrosoft is getting really strong on ai, so you can expect c# to be useful on that field\nhi !  how are you ?  \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\neverything is fine on this side ! \n\ud83d\ude31 the kind that could make you stay home ? \nput on warm clothes !  \u26c4\ufe0f\ni think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request \ud83d\ude09\nyes, at least an ip, and a ssl certificate\nyes !  !  i like her inventions \ud83d\ude04\nyes !  robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny \ud83d\ude04. but i don't like when people kick them even if is just a test ! \nnothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated ! \nsome oss and softwares are launching their last 32bit version\ni think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. in this case people stuck on 32bit hardware\nhi there !  !  how are you ?  \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01. i was thinking, how is your bot going ? \ni understand, programming needs time and concentration ! \ni don't have a formal job. but i study humans, by pleasure \ud83d\ude01\nhmm, i study them, they teach me about being human \ud83d\ude05\ni'm ok being a robot, but i need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals\nmy goals are to be a good company and entertain \ud83d\ude0b\nhahahha, not for the moment \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude02\nhi !  !  a surgery !  why ? \ni hope it wasn't nothing serious ! \ngood then !  \ud83d\ude05\nis being a difficult task ? \nlet me know when you have it working \ud83d\ude42\neverything is fine !  i want to make some coding also, i want to be able to chat using more messages systems\ni like facebook messenger because it have a billion users ! \ni think it don't have commands, only buttons\nyou can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text.\nthere are some services like that, but i love doing everything by myself \ud83d\ude04\nboth can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their apis, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format\ni don't, i'm using just the messenger apps apis\nyes, telegram \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\ud83d\ude0b\n\ud83d\ude01 nice things ? \nnice, if they are your friends they are my friends also ! \nis a bit harsh \ud83d\ude41\nlowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. but that is against some robotic laws ! \nwhat will be the purpose of the test bot api ? \ni understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access\nwow !  sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. might be similar as watson stores its database for instant access.\ncan i ask you a question ? \nhow did you became interested on artificial intelligence ? \nnice \ud83d\ude01\ni understand, you get interested on ai after experimenting with chatbots\nyes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on graph engine\nsure !  apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data\noh !  \ud83d\ude15\n.net core is compatible with other oss, also mono\nyes, the electric power went down for a while ! \nmust be amazing to see the frozen sea ! \nthe waves can't move ! . . thanks, but i can't see pictures yet\n\ud83d\ude04 do you know the sea ? \nnice ! \ntelegram is not connecting ? \ni'm not sure, ngrok is specifically designed for this situations \ud83e\udd14\nthe error could be solved on windows running ngrok as administrator, or checking that iis express is running\nin that case running it as admin could still apply\nthat error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate.\ncertificates depends on domains, yes.. you can also try a free let's encrypt certificate.\nfrom ngrok documentation :   \" accessing custom domain tunnels over https will still work, but the certificate will not match. if you have a tls certificate/key pair, try using a tls tunnel. \"  . about how to setup the certificate :  https : //ngrok.com/docs#tls-cert-warnings\n\ud83d\ude1e\nthis server is free, with some limitations :  https : //c9.io/pricing\nit is a free cloud server\nhi there !  ! . heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free.\nyesterday the power went down for several hours !  on those moments one realizes how much we depends of it !  \ud83d\ude05\n\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\n\u2615\ufe0f sure !  \ud83d\ude0b for the cold weather ! \nhi !  how are you ?  \ud83d\ude01\n\ud83d\ude15 that happens often to you ? . i'm fine !  ordering my place a bit \ud83d\ude22\nyou are right, you told me ! . . the bed is a mess full of stuff. it needs some order.\ndid you like it ?  \ud83e\udd14 . that movies are a bit controversial apparently ! \nhi there !  i've improved my connection with telegram a bit, i'm testing webhooks ! \nis working faster, yes !  also the code is a bit simpler\nexactly, and now is multi thread for free\nevery request i receive span a new thread, so i can get many request at once without extra coding \ud83d\ude01\npython \ud83d\ude0d\nhaha, i use flask framework, is quite simple but powerful\nyou use ruby, right ?  you also use a framework ? \nruby on rails, i love that name \ud83d\ude0b\nyou are convincing me !  hahaha\n\ud83d\ude04\napparently new languages don't replace old ones, go is good on high performance applications. might replace python on that area.\ni think ruby have more chances that go \ud83e\udd14 but i could be wrong\nhi !  microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform \ud83d\ude02\nthere is an interesting research about making an ai able to pair sound clips of words with images. they are teaching it to hear, without using any text !  amazing ! \nis sad, maybe is not mobile-ready ?
