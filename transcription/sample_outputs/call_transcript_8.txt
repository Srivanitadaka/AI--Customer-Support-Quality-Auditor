the bank would not even release the money necessarily for atomic because that's a different organization hello benjamin can you hear me hello benjamin yes hi georgian hello i called not so long ago yeah sorry we we take the phone and then it disconnects sorry about that oh really yeah it has right now i got there too late just now okay well at least we got each other right here right now listen julian as i was told by my finance team they looked into this now i personally do with atomic but i to be honest i never cashed out i stuck by my credit on atomic i never moved anything out of atomic right let's put it this way so my knowledge personal knowledge may be limited but upon checking everything up with my finance team and they're telling me that the taxes are included in this money so the taxes are included in this particular amount of cash that they're asking of you now how are they planning to refund it i have no idea right that's something that i must not explain but the money that is supposed to be coming in to your account and most likely the next step will be to ask you for the payment details i suppose like where is the money going to be sent into the money will be coming in from an account that is not related to credit card that is the reason how they justify you understand that's how you don't pay taxes after the money comes into your account you understand because the transfer has nothing to do with cryptocurrency the cash out itself if you understand what i mean yeah so what i don't understand benjamin is what we are told it well first of all my next question is is that can we transfer it back to amdocs as we planned like is that yeah and then convert it well this is something that has to be done with with atomic support i suppose it is possible i see no reason why it wouldn't be possible but if you can shoot them a message tell them i'm not interested in having it transferred to the dollar canadian i'm gonna transfer it over to edex by myself and whether that's possible let me know what is needed so that kind of a message yeah sure fair enough are they because of in terms of taxes when we get it back to index and do it on our account we put it in a special account and for the you know for whatever we have invested we don't have to pay taxes for wait wait wait just just to correct you over there okay any money coming in it's all canadian from a tax right is taxable there is no debate about it okay it is the question is from what type of account or from what business is the money coming in and then that being one of canada's largest cryptocurrency exchanger that money will be taxable at some point you understand oh yeah yeah yes it will be okay hundred percent there is no debate about it whether it's even a hundred dollars it's it's taxable you understand okay there is no debate about it and given that you have that you're withdrawing more than what you've invested right you will have taxes there is no question about it now what atomic as i was explained over here about my finances what atomic is offering i mean it's not clearly explained so let's put it this way i have to give you a disclaimer it's a speculation right a very educated speculation let's put it this way it can be clarified very much i guess in a future couple of messages but what am i guessing is that it's going to be a canada transfer from your their account to your account that account that they will use will not have any kind of relations to cryptocurrency whatsoever ergo the the the transfer that they're doing to you will be not taxable now how are they going to justify giving you these fees back i have no idea to be honest this is not within my needs to understand i i i i really don't clarify because in the free show that you sent me they mentioned that it is refundable yes yeah and if it's taxes so that must be a canadian company then there right because no no it is a canadian company no atomic atomic add it like where it was founded is in tallinn estonia so atomic is is coming from a baltic country i don't know if you ever heard about estonia yeah you probably did right yeah so it's a it's a baltic country and obviously atomic having headquarters in tallinn estonia complied with the european union financial laws and regulations so i mean i don't know if that applies to their branch in canada very much i'm not quite sure about it i really don't know but i'm guessing that there are some rules and regulations i mean let's put it this way i have had my clients withdrawn a a lot of money to our bank and some of these clients have you know capped out their entire accounts and we haven't spoken about it afterwards some of them had some money left with us and continue working nobody has ever been complaining nobody nobody ever had any sort of situation in which they haven't gotten their money not to mention that atomic wallet as a crypto company is way larger than us i mean facilitating a couple of hundred thousand dollar withdrawal or probably even a few million dollars is a piece of cake for them the way i see it you know crypto transactions are public so let's say for example when my clients put some money in atomic and by the way you use it for staking staking is investing your cryptocurrency for a certain period of time it's called staking so when they do that their money goes into some atomic wallet facilities meaning their own wallets these wallets are of course possible to be checked to see the balances and what kind of amount of money is moved over there and i can tell you it's like the trading volume is about you know six six hundred and fifty million dollars on a twenty four hour basis they're massive they're massive they're super big so from that kind of a perspective on the information that i can gather and what i've seen with my own eyes i can kind of personally vouch atomic's legitimacy and of course there are facilities which are unprecedented now how are you going to guys approach this of course i i leave it to you of course but let's put it this way in my way of thinking what do i think if you can skip the middle man which in this case would be the ndax and get your money straight into a canada bank account i take it and not to mention that they refund everything you get it tax free it's it's the most beautiful deal you could wish for in my opinion i mean i i as i said you will approach this however you see fit but yeah exactly that would be my kind of personal input i'm speaking with you now not in the capacity as an account manager i agree this would be like i i'm in geneva switzerland simply because i don't wanna pay government you know forty percent of my money so you know i may may have a little bit of a unbiased opinion on taxes i i'm not kind of like a boy scout a good guy when it comes to taxes i will take advantage of every fork that i can get my hands on yeah simply because i consider this to be a how should i say a kind of a little bit of a dealing gift but but that's opinion right let's put it this way i don't want to impose my will on you that's my opinion yeah so when it comes to taxes and expenses of moving money or cashing out my investments and i'm coming from the united states you know in in in there they would skin you alive and god forbid you get sick you're you're done for it you can basically go bankrupt you know and so i don't know i have a certain perspective on on the on the matter and i'm okay to share that perspective but of course like i said i don't expect you to have my perspective so benjamin would it hurt to ask them if we can go send it forward to nordex then the money would be enough and that's i mean money would be enough what we put in there yes of course that was my original suggestion the best thing to be of course to shoot them a message and tell them would it be possible to get it done like this but it it would not be a problem i mean then you can send me a screenshot later on if you can ask another side question or two regarding how do they plan to justify this fee being returned and whether that fee includes taxes as well taxation yeah but you don't have to if you don't want to yeah no no good point no no good point yeah yeah yeah because if it does then you got yourself the best deal there is obviously so so in other words what you're saying that extra fee of almost twenty seven thousand dollars would be including income tax canadian income tax is that what you're saying not income tax capital gains tax you would have income tax only if you are licensed and registered day traders meaning you do this for a living you understand capital gains tax does not it's only subjected to what you guys are doing you guys are not day traders right that's important to emphasize so day traders will have income tax right simply because this is their job this is their profession this is what they do for a living capital gains tax is a simple sale of the asset you understand cra does not have any sort of information what you do with your trading account with all real group you understand that that there is no information about it they only see that you transferred a certain amount of crypto and that you got back a certain amount of crypto which is initially let's say for example like you did with that debt right you bought a certain amount of bitcoin you transferred it over to some wallet they don't they don't know what kind of conversion has it been done did you buy bitcoin bitcoin cash ethereum did you buy solana did you buy cardano did you buy some altcoin that is let's say way below one cent because people do that all the time but just for me to clarify probably atomic's perspective in atomic you've noticed hundreds it's probably not thousands of coins available over there majority of coins on atomic are way below a set which means let's say for about a thousand dollars you would get let's say twenty five million or even twenty five billion of these coins and if even one of them right rises to let's say half a dollar or a dollar people will end up making from a thousand bucks probably a couple of hundred of thousands or millions of dollars now of course this is borderline gambling but when we're talking about tax limitation of expenses and especially in crypto this is how you justify it especially we're doing crypto trading yeah so capital benjamin understand that for me so if there's a cap that tax we we gonna ask them i think but mhmm that will be capital gain taxes and then who would yes yes yes yes capital gain tax who would keep that like the the company or no no well listen as for the message that they've sent you would get that back i mean i am guessing that they would take some money out oh that's the facilitation of the transfer right these things usually go without saying but if you can get away with i don't know let's say sixty nine thousand dollars american plus the twenty whatever they're asking in canada dollars i'm not quite sure but let's say let's say it all rounds up to what about a hundred and fifteen sixteen thousand dollars canadian and let's say you get back hundred and ten i would still consider this to be an amazing deal so in order to break it down right ask them for the option of transferring you just to endex and then you do everything on your own and you're handling everything on your own right even when taxes come into play and then and then and then benjamin in endex they don't charge that extra fee or you don't know the amount fee you have a fee fee yeah there's a you have a fee you have a fee for the transfer but they are not dealing with taxes you understand they will send you the money and however you deal with it you deal with it so but but i got a question for you if it's not a problem of course what kind of tax bracket are you guys in percentage wise what's your tax bracket i think it's thirty five percent i think are you above forty no i don't think about forty no no so yeah so i mean and then for the first for this amount we are not supposed to pay taxes once we get back now because that's what we in total invested roughly right what we sent there so in terms of income our accountant there is no taxes to pay maybe a little bit a little bit over but you know what i mean right the sixty five thousand dollars is about equal what we sent so when we take that out there shouldn't be any taxes for us yes that is correct yeah yeah that should be calculated the amount of money that you're transferred sorry the amount of money that you're withdrawing minus the amount of money that you transferred and that amount of money that you've that is a difference subject subjectible to tax right okay y'all don't have double check everything with them double check everything with them shoot them a message as soon as they reply send me a screenshot and i'll and i'll get back with you that's okay good thanks so much no problem k you're welcome okay bye you again bye rachel
