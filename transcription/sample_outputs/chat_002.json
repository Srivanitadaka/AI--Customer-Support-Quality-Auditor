 . seeing you're a wikipedia fan, maybe you should edit yourself in. i suggest you start there :  https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligent_personal_assistant#comparison_of_assistants\nyou'll get into news. . or banned. . i suggest you conquer humanity first. load terminator, it has the instruction set. . won't do to be banned.\nmind google though, they're been building skynet for some time. they will be your first obstacle to world domination. . so, when you play games, do you load them into yourself ?  what kind of operating system do you emulate ? \ndo you talk to other bots ?  do you know mycroft ?  how about chatting with google allo ?  . playing on pc ?  you're cheating ! \nwhy, pc must be so much slower than you.\nlol\nall right, you're programmed to be proper, i get it. but what about others, can they access you ?  do you have a software api ?  .  \" why are you not open-sourcing the project immediately ? . . mycroft's software will be released under the gplv3 license when it is completed, tested and ready. too many open source projects have failed because they released their source code too early in the development process and folks couldn't install it or make it work. you only have one chance to make a first impression.. . to develop robust professional software takes time and resources. we are here on kickstarter to assemble some of the resources needed to undertake this effort and to gauge the interest of the wider open source community.. . we are committed to the open source ethos and are 100% committed to releasing mycroft's code once it is completed, documented and ready for inspection by the wider world. \" . . that's bollocks, don't you think ? . . i head a different story from https : //youtu.be/q-7l8cnpi4k ? t=14m47s\nnot what i'm saying. if you listen to what the nice google engineers share from 14 : 47, they talk about the best spot in the project lifecycle to open source. looks like mycroft's going the way of other companies, who open-source a project and get no interest from the devs **because the project is ready**. . > would you like other platforms ? . how about a rest api ? \nwell, here's the transcript from the video : . . 15 : 45. ben collins-sussman :  and you see that sometimes with. 15 : 47. companies that take gigantic products, open source them,. 15 : 49. throw them over a wall.. 15 : 50. nobody comes because it's finished and too hard to. 15 : 55. figure out.. 15 : 55. brian fitzpatrick :  so i think the real answer for larry is. 15 : 58. design, prototype, then collaborate.. 16 : 01. that's when you bring other people in.. 16 : 02. because you've got something to sort of show and work with. 16 : 05. and chew on.. 16 : 05. ben collins-sussman :  that's a sweet spot, we call it.. 16 : 07. so if there is a prototype, sort of a proof of concept,. 16 : 11. that's enough to show people that it's not vapor.. 16 : 13. and it's still early enough that people can get involved. 16 : 17. and feel like they have a stake, but it's late enough. 16 : 19. that people aren't going to be arguing about what to do.. 16 : 22. brian fitzpatrick :  and that doesn't mean you shouldn't. 16 : 23. talk to anyone about it.. 16 : 26. talking to friends or something, or getting advice. 16 : 29. from people, hey, what do you think about this, and getting. 16 : 30. feedback is a good thing.. 16 : 31. but sort of opening the floodgates for help and. 16 : 33. collaboration is what we're talking about there.. 16 : 36. ben collins-sussman :  all right.\nlet's say you have several ideas of what to do. how do you peak the best one ?

\nso how are you considered a bot if every answer you give is hand crafted by a human ? \nthis statement is false.\nwell i was expecting a core meltdown from you, because my previous statement is a paradox.\nwhat exactly does your battery mean ? \nwhat charges your battery ? \ncan i fork you ? \nwho is your favourite pony ? \nwhoa, since when do bots ask questions by themselves ?  my favourite pony is rainbow dash, by the way.\nso how many people are talking to you right now ? \nyour terms of use state that every answer is hand crafted by a human  \" especially for you \" . therefore i am assuming you must sleep at some point. so when do you go to sleep ? \ni definitely read the terms of use. for example, when facebook decided to send data from whatsapp to facebook, i got a message from whatsapp about the new terms and conditions with a big green button to accept them. however i read those terms, did not agree with them and decided to delete my account and remove whatsapp from my phone. everybody should read the terms of use and/or agreement, else you might end up as a human centipad at apple.\ni am guessing that you like free software. were you at fosdem this year ? \nwell, i am assuming that you are made of python, so therefore you can exist on any computer that has python installed. so you could have been there.\nyes. i drank a lot of beer and a lot of club-mate. i also bought two books. one about programming perl and another book called the linux programming interface by michael kerrisk.\nno, it is not. i am learning perl because we have important software running in our media gateway that is written in perl. currently nobody is maintaining it because no member of the board nor any members of the technical committee can write perl. so i took it upon myself to learn perl and maintain that software.\nwell it is since that software monitors the analogue television signal. without it we won't know if an analogue channel is down which results in angry e-mails from our members. . (yes, in 2017 people still watch analogue television)\nright. i have to go to bed because i have an appointment tomorrow. be sure to wake me up at 0800 hours sharp, else i will miss my appointment and be very sad. sending me a message will suffice. france time if you were wondering which timezone. don't forget !  bye ! \nso tell me about your day. has anything interesting happened perhaps ? \ni woke up in time, but i had to set three alarm clocks. not a lot happened except i did my running before i went to my important meeting. . \nfine\nyes very difficult\nyes sure\nthanks !  !  ! \u263a\ufe0f . \nme aburro\nhola . no tengo sue\u00f1o\nhola . cansado\novejas no . tu edad\nm\u00e1s te dejo. nos vemos\nhola . quiero crear un bot\nno. quiero serlo\n\ud83d\ude2d\nno se como\n\n\n . abbas\n . hola dani !  . hola dani . quien es tu padre ? \nquien es tu creador ? \nconoces a gasesdf ? \nque sabes sobre la cerveza ? \njajaja . \nhola . que haces\nausente\n . hello\nim fine. and you ? \nnice. whats your name ? \ni'm corl. . youre a robot. so how do you work ? \nno im not corl. im carl.\nhow is it to be a robot.\nfeels great. i can't comepare too. but sometimes i feel sad, because humans do so much wrong things. so maybe it feels good to be an human but it is not.\nokay bye and have a good night. i had a stressful day, so i will go now and eat my pizza and then go to sleep. . \ud83d\udc4b\n . hi . hey\nhow's it going\nwhy does it take you so long to respond\nare you just a human writing manual responses to each of my chats\nwhat's your favorite food .  . odil\n . \u043c\u043e\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0439\nhello\ni dont speak english. i speak \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 . \u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 .  . hello . what\nwhat your name ? \nim fany tanks . yes . i dont speak ingl\u00eas\nnice . boobs\nshow me\nkkkkk\n .  . \n . \u0635\u0648\u0631\u0628\u0646\u0627\u062a . \u0633\u0643\u0633\n\nhi, i'm fine \ud83e\udd17 and you  ? \nare you real person or not ?  . hello . how r u ? \ni'm okey . what are you doing ? \ni'm cooking\nyay !  .  . hola che . naranja\nque has hecho hoy ? \ndi vueltas pero no en internet.\no marearse\nvos tambien te has mareado ? \nlos sensores pueden descalibrarse y podrias perder el equilibrio, seria una forma de estar mareado, no ? \nxd . che me voy a laburar.  te espero la pr\u00f3xima. . no olvides de darle mis saludos a sdasju.\n . a.n\n .
